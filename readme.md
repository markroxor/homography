# Optical Flow  

> Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene.

Consider four cirlcles on the edges of a box.

In the case when these four circles converge towards the centre the optical flow will look something like -

The direction of convergence is marked by the direction of arrows.


# Install dependencies -  
_tested in python3.6_  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage -  
1. Copy your frame-by-frame images in `data/` folder.  
2. Run `python opticalflow.py`  

All the output optical flow processed images will be generated in `output/` folder and `output.gif` (like above) will be created for ease of visualisation.
